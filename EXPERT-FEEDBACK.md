# Expert Feedback & Implementation Plan

## Context

This document summarizes key insights from a conversation with a South Sudan healthcare expert (February 2026) and maps them to concrete features implemented in the Taban EMR system.

The expert has direct experience with South Sudan's health system at all levels — from Boma (village) to national. The conversation focused on how technology can realistically improve healthcare delivery given the constraints: limited literacy, poor infrastructure, few trained clinicians, and fragile/conflict-affected settings.

## Key Insights from Expert

### 1. AI Clinical Companion ("The Diagnostic Machine")

> "You are providing him a tool, he can just plug it, put in the symptoms and then he gets an idea of what the problem is... It's a package of algorithms that helps him come to you with a diagnosis. And then the AI courses it and suggests treatment based on your treatment guidelines."

**Problem:** Clinical officers and Boma Health Workers at PHCU/Payam level lack diagnostic confidence. They can identify symptoms but struggle to connect them to diagnoses and appropriate treatments.

**Solution:** An AI companion that takes symptoms as input and returns:

- Ranked differential diagnoses with confidence scores
- Recommended treatments based on South Sudan national guidelines
- Suggested diagnostic tests to confirm
- Severity assessment (treat locally vs. refer)

**Analogy the expert used:** "If a car has a flat tire, you can fix it roadside. But if the engine has a problem, you need a diagnostic machine. We're giving the health worker that diagnostic machine."

### 2. Voice-Based Data Capture

> "As a guy is doing and you're typing it or even with the voice it is capturing directly and translating it."

**Problem:** Health workers in communities may have limited literacy. Typing clinical notes on a phone is slow and error-prone.

**Solution:** Voice recording that automatically captures clinical encounters and extracts structured data (symptoms, diagnoses, treatments) without requiring the health worker to type.

**Key insight:** "The local person doesn't know that this is a recorder. It just seems like the person has put out his phone."

### 3. Focus on Payam Level First

> "Play on Payam level first... The Payam supervises Bomas. They need to know which Boma is working and which is not working."

**Problem:** There are ~2,400 Bomas in South Sudan, each with a BHW managing ~40 households. Payam supervisors have no visibility into which BHWs are active, how many patients they're seeing, or what conditions they're finding.

**Solution:** A Payam Supervisor dashboard that shows:
- Which BHWs are active vs. inactive
- Visit counts and referral rates per BHW
- Follow-up completion rates
- Ability to drill into individual BHW records for remote review

### 4. Real-Time Immunization Defaulter Tracker

> "You are trying to present real-time data. Not something aggregated after a month. Real time, every week this man knows how many have defaulted. Immunization defaulter tracker. Even if you don't do these other things, do this."

**Problem:** South Sudan has one of the lowest immunization coverage rates in the world. Children who miss vaccine doses ("defaulters") are not tracked in real-time — data is aggregated monthly, by which point outreach is too late.

**Solution:** Per-child, real-time tracking of:
- Which children are overdue for which vaccines
- How many days overdue (urgency color coding)
- Which BHW/Boma they belong to
- Outreach lists for field follow-up

**Expert emphasis:** This works in IDP camps and fragile settings. "Hourly — does it go out? In an IDP camp, a tracker in a fragile setting. It's a tracker."

### 5. Remote Patient Review

> "The person can also go back remotely and look at those things that have been recorded, I review them. So it provides for the clinical officer to go and review."

**Problem:** BHWs make clinical decisions alone in the field. There's no feedback loop — no one reviews whether the BHW's assessment was correct or if follow-up care is needed.

**Solution:** Supervisors and clinical officers can remotely review BHW-submitted visits, add clinical notes, approve or flag for follow-up. This creates:
- Quality assurance for community health data
- Mentorship opportunities (supervisor feedback)
- Patient safety net (catching missed diagnoses)

### 6. Continuous Learning Tool

> "It also becomes a learning tool for the clinical officer. The person doesn't have to go to workshops. You link WHO references, Lancet publications, they can read."

**Problem:** Clinical officers in rural areas rarely attend continuing education. Their knowledge becomes outdated, and there's no easy way to access current treatment guidelines.

**Solution:** After each AI diagnosis suggestion, show:
- Treatment rationale with references
- Links to WHO guidelines, Lancet articles, South Sudan national protocols
- "Learn More" sections that explain the clinical reasoning

## Expert's Strategic Advice

### "The Elephant and the Trunk"

> "There's so much to do. This is the big elephant. But let us look at a trunk. What is in it? You don't notice the trunk is the important part — it sucks up water and feeds. So you now realize you are contributing to the whole menu of the health management information system. What you're looking at is your quality."

**Translation:** Don't try to build the entire national HIS. Focus on data quality at the point of care — the trunk that feeds everything above it.

### "Logical Framework"

> "You need to have a framework. What do you want as an input? What do you want as an output? What you want is an outcome."

- **Input:** Symptoms, patient encounters, vaccine records
- **Output:** Diagnoses, treatment plans, defaulter lists, supervisor dashboards
- **Outcome:** Improved quality of care, reduced missed diagnoses, higher immunization coverage

### "DHIS2 Compatibility"

> "To ease yourself, you don't need to bother your head. You just make it compatible with DHIS2."

The national reporting system uses DHIS2. All data captured at lower levels should be exportable in DHIS2-compatible format for national aggregation.

## Implementation Status

| # | Feature | Status | Priority |
|---|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | AI Clinical Companion (Symptom Checker) | Implemented | Highest |
| 2 | Payam Supervisor Dashboard | Implemented | Highest |
| 3 | Immunization Defaulter Tracker | Implemented | Highest |
| 4 | Voice Capture for Boma Dashboard | Implemented | High |
| 5 | Remote Patient Review Workflow | Implemented | High |
| 6 | Clinical Reference Links | Implemented | Medium |

### Technical Architecture

All features run **offline-first** using PouchDB (IndexedDB) in the browser. The AI diagnosis engine and medical knowledge base operate entirely client-side — no internet required for clinical decision support.

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Multi-language support** — Juba Arabic, Dinka, Nuer translations for the BHW interface
2. **SMS notifications** — Immunization reminders to guardians via basic phones
3. **Photo-based patient ID** — Camera capture for illiterate populations (DB fields exist)
4. **Tablet-optimized layout** — Expert mentioned tablet use at PHCC level
5. **Field testing** — Deploy to one Payam in Central Equatoria for real-world validation
6. **DHIS2 live sync** — Move from export-only to real-time DHIS2 integration
